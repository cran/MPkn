Description: A matrix discrete model having the form
    'M[i+1] = (I + Q)*M[i]'.
    The calculation of the values of 'M[i]' only for
    pre-selected values of 'i'. The method of calculation
    is presented in the vignette 'Fundament' ('Base'). Maybe it`s own
    idea of the author of the package. A weakness is that the method
    gives information only in selected steps of the process.
    It mainly refers to cases with matrices that are not Markov chain.
    If 'Q' is Markov transition matrix, then MUPkL() may be
    used to calculate the steady-state distribution 'p' for
    'p = Q*p'.
    Matrix power of non integer (matrix.powerni()) gives
    the same results as a mpower() from package 'matlib'.
